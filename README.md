# Fractalchat

Fractalchat is an AI-powered chat interface designed for deep, nonlinear exploration of ideas and building knowledge.
Instead of a single linear thread, users can highlight any word or phrase mid-conversation to branch off into a recursive sub-threadâ€”allowing tangents, side questions, and deep dives without losing the original context.
