# Fractalchat Product Requirements Document

## Overview

Fractalchat is an AI-powered chat interface that lets users branch conversations from any highlighted text, producing an explorable tree of threads. This recursive structure not only preserves context but also mirrors the natural, recursive process people use to acquire knowledge.

## Problem Statement

Linear chat interfaces force users into a trade-off:

- Lose context when following (inevitable) tangential questions
- Clutter the main thread with side discussions
- Abandon interesting detours to stay on topic

This results in missed insights, scattered notes, and less effective knowledge-building for users.
