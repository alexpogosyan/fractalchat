FractalMap is an AI-powered chat app built for deep, nonlinear thinking. Users can hold conversations with a language model, and at any point, select a word or phrase to create a branching sub-thread—turning the dialogue into a living, navigable map of information. It’s a recursive tool for exploring ideas and building knowledge.
